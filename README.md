# iris-classification
This project demonstrates a simple implementation of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm for classifying Iris flowers based on their features.

Overview
The Iris dataset is a well-known dataset in the field of machine learning and consists of measurements for three species of Iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The features include sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries:
scikit-learn
numpy
